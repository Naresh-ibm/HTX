	Took my family away from my Carolina home.
	Had dreams about the way it stands, started to roam.
	Six long months on a dust covered trail.
	They say heaven's at the end but so far its been hell.

	We were diggin' and siftin' from five to five.
	Sellin' ev'ry thing we found just to stay alive.
	Gold flowed free like the wiskey in the bars.
	Sinnin' was the big thing Lord, and Satan was the star.

	Dance hall girls were the evenin' treat.
	Empty cartridges and blood lines, the glitters of the street.
	Men were shot down for the sake of fun,
	Or just to hear the noise of their 44 guns.

	Now my widow, she weeps by my grave.
	Tears flow free for her man she couldn't save.
	Shot down in cold blood by a gun that carried fame.
	All for a useless and no good, worthless claim.

	And there's     Fire on the mountain,
			Lightning in the air.
			Gold in them hills
			And its wait'n for me there.
