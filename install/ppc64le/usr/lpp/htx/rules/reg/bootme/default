###############################################################################
# Please refer to /usr/lpp/htx/rules/reg/bootme.doc for more details.
#
# Syntax Requirements:
# 1) Statements must not have leading spaces.
# 2) Statements must have a colon immediately following it.
# 3) There must be a single space after the colon.
#
#
###############################################################################
# To change the reboot time(s), remove the comment "#" from ONLY ONE of the
# REBOOT statements below, or add/edit one to suit your needs.
#
# REBOOT can NOT be modified "on-the-fly" - refer to bootme.doc for details
#
# The first field in the crontab entry denotes minutes (0-59) in an hour and
# the second denotes hours (0-23) in a 24 hour day.  The time elements must
# all be contiguous - no spaces between any of the characters. The time
# elements must be legal crontab entries.  Only two space seperated items
# are allowed after "REBOOT:"
#
# Example 1: will reboot every half hour (0,30), every hour (*)
# Example 2: will reboot every 20 minutes (0,20,40), every hour (*)
# Example 3: will reboot at the top of each hour specified in the hour field
#            (Midnight, 4am, 8am, 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm).  Do not place the 
#            wildcard "*" in the minutes position as this will cause your
#            test system to reboot continuously during the hours in the 
#            second field.
# Example 4: will reboot every half hour during the hours in the hour field.
#
# If you must use crontab fields other than minutes and hours, then you should
# run "bootme on" and manually edit the crontab entry (crontab -e).  The
# bootme scripts only allows for the setting of these two fields and does pad
# the remaining crontab time entries with "*" wildcards.  Adding a third or
# fourth entry in this default profile will result in unexpected behavior.

REBOOT: 0,30 *
#REBOOT: 0,20,40 *
#REBOOT: 0 0,4,8,12,16,20
#REBOOT: 0,30 0,4,8,12,16,20

# Method to run bootme.
# Only one uncommented item allowed for this statement type.
#
# "single" is the default method that most will use. Uncomment ONE BOOT_CMD
#          and bootme will use it for every reboot.
# "random" selects a random method from the list of uncommented BOOT_CMD's.
#          Uncomment 2 or more BOOT_CMD's when using this method.
# "sequential" will select, in order, from the uncommented BOOT_CMD's.
#          Uncomment 2 or more BOOT_CMD's when using this method.
#
# BOOT_METHOD can be modified "on-the-fly" - refer to bootme.doc for details
