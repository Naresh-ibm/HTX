# This is a configuration file for hxemem64 to set various parameters for 
# multi-processor memory testing
# It has parameters the mem_percent, cpu_percent, cpu_list
# Note : cpu_list takes precedence over the actual CPUs present for cpu_percent 
#        consideration. If both cpu_percent and cpu_list are specified, cpu_percent
#        of the processors specified in cpu_list is calculated. It has to be taken 
#        care that the processor numbers specified in the cpu_list are valid

# The lines commented below with some sample values for the parameters are as 
# an example. The values can be modified according to the requirements 
# and '#' symbol before each parameter be removed.

#   mem_percent = 70%
#   cpu_percent = 50%
#   cpu_list = 0,1,2,3
