01-     In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine |
02-in the land, and a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together   |
03-with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the|
04-country of Moab.  The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's |
05-name Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and  |
06-Kilion.  They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah.  And |
07-they went to Moab and lived there.                         |
08-     Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left|
09-with her two sons.  They married Moabite women, one name   |
10-Orpah and the other Ruth.  After they had lived there about|
11-ten years, both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was |
12-left without her two sons and her husband.                 |
13-     When she heard in Moab that the Lord had come to the  |
14-aid of his people by food for them, Naomi and her          |
15-daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there.  With |
16-her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had  |
17-been living and set out on the road that would take them   |
18-back to the land of Judah.                                 |
19-     Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go back,|
20-each of you, to your mother's home.  May the Lord show     |
21-kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me. |
22-May the Lord grant that each of you will find rest in the  |
23-home of another husband."                                  |
24-     Then she kissed them and they wept aloud and said to  |
25-her, "We will go back with you to your people."            |
26-     But Naomi said, "Return home, my daughters.  Why would|
27-you come with me?  Am I going to have any more sons, who   |
28-could become your husbands?  Return home, my daughters; I  |
29-am too old to have another husband.  Even if I thought     |
30-there was still hope for me -- even if I had a husband     |
31-tonight and then gave birth to sons -- would you wait until|
