HTX README
==========
Brief Overview
--------------
The Hardware Test Executive (HTX) is a suite of test tools for hardware validation of OpenPOWER system.
The HTX stress tests the system by exercising all or selected hardware components concurrently to
uncover any hardware design flaws and hardware-hardware or hardware-software interaction issues.
The HTX consists of test programs (a.k.a exercisers) to test processor, memory and IO subsystem of POWER system. 
The HTX runs on PowerKVM guests (Linux distributions like Ubuntu, SuSE and Redhat), and OPAL-based
distributions (like Ubuntu) and on Linux host machine. HTX supports two types of control interfaces
to exercisers, user interactive and command line.
