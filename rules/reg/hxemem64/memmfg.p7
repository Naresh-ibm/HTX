* This rule files is primarily used by manufacturing
* This combinations of patterns and associated iterations is able to stress
* the memory for a minimum length of time, as required by manufacturing.
* Hxemem waits for 90 seconds before allocating any memory for the test.
* Memory that remains after the OS and other apps have allocated their's,
* is used for the test.
* In this case, 90 percent of remaining memory will be used up.
